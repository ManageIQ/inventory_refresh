        #         - nil => InventoryObject objects of the InventoryCollection will be saved to the DB, only these objects
        #                  will be referable from the other InventoryCollection objects.
        #         - :local_db_cache_all => Loads InventoryObject objects from the database, it loads all the objects that
        #                                  are a result of a [<:parent>.<:association>, :arel] taking
        #                                  first defined in this order. This strategy will not save any objects in the DB.

        #                                        were referenced by the other InventoryCollections using a filtered result

        #                                                the DB. Then if we reference an object that is not present, it will
        #                                                load them from the db using :local_db_find_references strategy.
        # @param saver_strategy [Symbol] A strategy that will be used for InventoryCollection persisting into the DB.
        #        Allowed saver strategies are:
        #        - :default => Using Rails saving methods, this way is not safe to run in multiple workers concurrently,
        #          since it will lead to non consistent data.
        #        - :batch => Using batch SQL queries, this way is not safe to run in multiple workers
        #          concurrently, since it will lead to non consistent data.
        #        - :concurrent_safe_batch => It uses atomic upsert to avoid data duplication and it uses timestamp based
        #          atomic checks to avoid new data being overwritten by the the old data. The upsert/update queries are
        #          executed as batched SQL queries, instead of sending 1 query per record.
        # @param retention_strategy [Symbol] A retention strategy for this collection. Allowed values are:
        #        - :destroy => Will destroy the inactive records.
        #        - :archive => Will archive the inactive records by setting :archived_at timestamp.
        # @param delete_method [Symbol] A delete method that will be used for deleting of the InventoryObject, if the
        #        object is marked for deletion. A default is :destroy, the instance method must be defined on the
        #        :model_class.

        # @param manager_ref [Array] Array of Symbols, that are keys of the InventoryObject's data, inserted into this
        #        InventoryCollection. Using these keys, we need to be able to uniquely identify each of the InventoryObject
        #        objects inside.
        # @param manager_ref_allowed_nil [Array] Array of symbols having manager_ref columns, that are a foreign key an can
        #        be nil. Given the table are shared by many providers, it can happen, that the table is used only partially.
        #        Then it can happen we want to allow certain foreign keys to be nil, while being sure the referential
        #        integrity is not broken. Of course the DB Foreign Key can't be created in this case, so we should try to
        #        avoid this usecase by a proper modeling.

        # @param dependency_attributes [Hash] Manually defined dependencies of this InventoryCollection. We can use this
        #        by manually place the InventoryCollection into the graph, to make sure the saving is invoked after the
        #        dependencies were saved. The dependencies itself are InventoryCollection objects. For a common use-cases
        #        we do not need to define dependencies manually, since those are inferred automatically by scanning of the
        #        data.
        #
        #        Example:
        #          :dependency_attributes => {
        #            :orchestration_stacks           => [collections[:orchestration_stacks]],
        #            :orchestration_stacks_resources => [collections[:orchestration_stacks_resources]]
        #          }
        #        This example is used in Example2 of the <param custom_save_block> and it means that our :custom_save_block
        #        will be invoked after the InventoryCollection :orchestration_stacks and :orchestration_stacks_resources
        #        are saved.
        # @param parent_inventory_collections [Array] Array of symbols having a name pointing to the
        #        InventoryRefresh::InventoryCollection objects, that serve as parents to this InventoryCollection. There are
        #        several scenarios to consider, when deciding if InventoryCollection has parent collections, see the example.
        #
        #        Example:
        #          taking inventory collections :vms and :disks (local disks), if we write that:
        #          inventory_collection = InventoryCollection.new({
        #                       :model_class                 => ::Disk,
        #                       :association                 => :disks,
        #                       :manager_ref                 => [:vm, :location]
        #                       :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms],
        #                     })
        #
        #          Then the decision for having :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms] was probably driven by these
        #          points:
        #          1. We can get list of all disks only by doing SQL query through the parent object (so there will be join
        #             from vms to disks table).
        #          2. There is no API query for getting all disks from the provider API, we get them inside VM data, or as
        #             a Vm subquery
        #          3. Part of the manager_ref of the IC is the VM object (foreign key), so the disk's location is unique
        #             only under 1 Vm. (In current models, this modeled going through Hardware model)
        #          4. In targeted refresh, we always expect that each Vm will be saved with all its disks.
        #
        #          Then having the above points, adding :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms], will bring these
        #          implications:
        #          1. By archiving/deleting Vm, we can no longer see the disk, because those were owned by the Vm. Any
        #             archival/deletion of the Disk model, must be then done by cascade delete/hooks logic.
        #          2. Having Vm as a parent ensures we always process it first. So e.g. when providing no Vms for saving
        #             we would have no graph dependency (no data --> no edges --> no dependencies) and Disk could be
        #             archived/removed before the Vm, while we always want to archive the VM first.
        #          3. For targeted refresh, we always expect that all disks are saved with a VM. So for targeting :disks,
        #             we are not using #manager_uuids attribute, since the scope is "all disks of all targeted VMs", so we
        #             always use #manager_uuids of the parent. (that is why :parent_inventory_collections and
        #             :manager_uuids are mutually exclusive attributes)
        #          4. For automatically building the #targeted_arel query, we need the parent to know what is the root node.
        #             While this information can be introspected from the data, it creates a scope for create&update&delete,
        #             which means it has to work with no data provided (causing delete all). So with no data we cannot
        #             introspect anything.

        #
        #        In the Example2 of the <param custom_save_block>, we have a custom saving code, that saves a :parent
        #        attribute of the OrchestrationStack. That means we don't want that attribute saved as a part of
        #        InventoryCollection for OrchestrationStack, so we would set :attributes_blacklist => [:parent]. Then the
        #        :parent will be ignored while saving.
        # @param attributes_whitelist [Array] Same usage as the :attributes_blacklist, but defining full set of attributes
        #        that should be saved. Attributes that are part of :manager_ref and needed validations are automatically
        #        added.
        # @param inventory_object_attributes [Array] Array of attribute names that will be exposed as readers/writers on the
        #        InventoryObject objects inside.

        #          inventory_object = inventory_collection.build(:ems_ref => "vm1", :name => "vm1")
        #        We can use inventory_object_attributes as setters and getters:
        #          inventory_object.name = "Name"
        #          inventory_object.label = inventory_object.name

        #          inventory_object[:label] = inventory_object[:name]

        #        Example2 - saving parent OrchestrationStack in a more effective way, than the default saving algorithm can

        #        ActiveRecord association. That leads in N+1 queries in the default saving algorithm, so we can do better
        #        with custom saving for now. The InventoryCollection is defined as a custom dependencies processor,
